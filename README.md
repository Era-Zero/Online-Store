# Sunglasses-Store

## Description
My project makes use of Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS to create a functioning sunglasses store.
I use a classic simplistic Bootstrap theme for the overall look and feel fo the website while using the Jquery for a 
basic functions ( eg.animated background, fade toggle ) and the Javascript for the functioning of the shopping cart.

## Landing-Page
The landing page of the website contains a basic about section fo the company as well as testimonials,
It also makes use of the Jquery to hide the testimonials and create an animated background for the store.

## Contact-Page
Uses a basic form design from Bootstrap to allow the user to input their information to email us their enquiries.

## Store-Page
Makes use of Javascript to create all the functions to add, remove, order, clear the cart as well as the buttons that allow us to add to the cart.

## Installation

Open the code editor of your choice and run it.

## Usage
You can modify this project however you see fit the Javascript item values are hardcoded into the HTML,
so you can swap out the products and price to suit your needs.
